### Read in a graph, a set of vertices, and a pair of vertices. 

import graph
import sys

## Implement your algorithm here:
#For testpair1, v = 0, w = 7
def algorithm(g, B, v, w):
  n = 0
  #print("worked")





  return n


### Read in a set of vertices from a file. These are just numbers separated by whitespace.
def readset(filename):
  f = open(filename, 'r')
  s = set()
  for line in f:
    for v in line.split():
      s.add(int(v))
  return s

## Read the pair, again, just two integers separated by whitespace.
def readpair(filename):
  f = open(filename, 'r')
  for line in f:
    (v,w) = line.split()
    return (int(v), int(w))


### If ran from the command line:
if __name__ == "__main__":
  # Graph is the first command line argument:
  g = graph.Graph()
  g.readgraph(sys.argv[1])
  # Vertices are the second command line argument:
  B = readset(sys.argv[2])
  # Pair is the third command line argument:
  (v,w) = readpair(sys.argv[3])

  ### Call your algorithm:

  n = algorithm(g, B, v, w)

  # Print the result:
  print(n)
